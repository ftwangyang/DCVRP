# Time-driven periodic-static classical baselines

All values are measured on 100 instances. Time(100) is the sum of the 100 per-instance elapsed solve times, including all eleven planning calls; it is not the shortened parallel wall time.

Environment: 10 synchronized intervals; complete static multi-vehicle solve at each boundary; commit only customer legs with start < next boundary; destroy unstarted suffixes without charging them; terminal solve at T=480.
